# Using R in Hydrology - EGU2022 Short Course

In this repository we will collect information about the short course "Using R in hydrology" which will be held at the EGU general assembly in 2022.

R is an open-source, versatile programming language that is suitable for multi-scale analyses from just a few observations to big data and high-performance computing. It has a growing, enthusiastic user-base (including hydrologists) that is responsible for a continuous stream of ever more efficient and useful packages and workflows.

Running for its sixth year, this EGU short course, co-organised by the Young Hydrologic Society (younghs.com), will introduce and showcase a selection of both core and recently developed R packages that can be applied to data analyses in hydrology, as well as other scientific disciplines.

The course will be delivered by hydrologists with wide experience in subjects including hydrological modelling (including flood and drought analysis), forecasting, statistics, and eco-hydrology.

This course contributes new topics to those delivered in previous years, building upon the openly accessible Github repository for hydrologists using R in their work (https://github.com/hydrosoc).


## Details 

- **Where?** Thursday 26 May, 8:30-10:00 CEST in room 2.61/2.62 or online.
- **What?** This session is aimed at hydrologists who are interested in hearing more about R as well as those who are advanced R programmers wanting to discuss recent developments in an open environment. 
- The session is organised in cooperation with the [Young Hydrologic Society (YHS)](https://younghs.com/ "Young Hydrologic Society website") .
- Participants are invited to post and discuss questions in the [Hydrology in R Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1130214777123909/ "link to Hydro-R Facebook group")

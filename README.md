Using R in Hydrology - EGU2022 Short Course

In this repository we will collect information about the short course "Using R in hydrology" which will be held at the EGU general assembly in 2022.


Session details

R is an open-source, versatile programming language that is suitable for multi-scale analyses from just a few observations to big data and high-performance computing. It has a growing, enthusiastic user-base (including hydrologists) that is responsible for a continuous stream of ever more efficient and useful packages and workflows.

Running for its fifth year, this EGU short course, co-organised by the Young Hydrologic Society (younghs.com), will introduce and showcase a selection of both core and recently developed R packages that can be applied to data analyses in hydrology, as well as other scientific disciplines.

The course will be delivered by hydrologists with wide experience in subjects including: hydrological modelling (including flood and drought analysis), forecasting, statistics, and eco-hydrology.

Topics covered in this years’ course include:
• Using R in education (Claudia Brauer)
• Identification of hydrologic events (Conrad Wasko + Danlu Guo)
• Flood forecast verification in R (Andrea Ficchi)
• The (mis)use of colours in scientific visualizations (Michael Stoelzle)
• Machine learning for spatio-temporal modelling (Razi Sheikholeslami)

This course contributes new topics to those delivered in previous years, building upon the openly accessible Github repository for hydrologists using R in their work (https://github.com/hydrosoc).
